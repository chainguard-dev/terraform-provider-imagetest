# NOTE: There is no shebang here! This code will be piped as stdin to the shell
# chosen by the test author, which may be any of: sh, bash, fish or zsh.
#
# NOTE: Multiple scripts are piped to stdin end-to-end, this means an exit code
# provided here is an exit code to _all_ sequenced preparation commands.
# Considering this, all workflows should be implemented with functions which are
# conditionally called and only exit if a truly test-breaking scenario occurs
# and the entire run should fail.

# >> Overview
#
#   stdopts.sh defines the standard Bash session configuration and some helper
#   functions. These are prefixed to all ec2 driver commands.

# Exit on the first non-zero exit we hit, failures terminate pipelines.

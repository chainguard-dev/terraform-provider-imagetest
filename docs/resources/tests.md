## Schema

### Required

- `driver` (String) The driver to use for the test suite. Only one driver can be used at a time.
- `images` (Map of String) Images to use for the test suite.

### Optional

- `drivers` (Attributes) The resource specific driver configuration. This is merged with the provider scoped drivers configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--drivers))
- `labels` (Map of String) Metadata to attach to the tests resource. Used for filtering and grouping.
- `name` (String) The name of the test. If one is not provided, a random name will be generated.
- `skipped` (Boolean) Whether or not the tests were skipped. This is set to true if the tests were skipped, and false otherwise.
- `tests` (Attributes List) An ordered list of test suites to run (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tests))
- `timeout` (String) The maximum amount of time to wait for all tests to complete. This includes the time it takes to start and destroy the driver.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the test. If a name is provided, this will be the name appended with a random suffix.

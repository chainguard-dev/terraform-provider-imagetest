- `networks` (Attributes Map) A map of existing networks to attach the container to. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--networks))
- `privileged` (Boolean)
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))
- `volumes` (Attributes List) The volumes this harness should mount. This is received as a mapping from imagetest_container_volume resources to destination folders. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--volumes))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the harness. This is generated from the inventory seed and harness name.
- `skipped` (Boolean) Whether or not to skip creating the harness based on runtime inputs and the dependent features within this inventory.

Example resource



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `harness` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--harness))
- `name` (String) The name of the feature

### Optional

- `after` (Attributes List) Actions to run againast the harness after the core steps have run OR after a step has failed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--after))
- `before` (Attributes List) Actions to run against the harness before the core feature steps. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--before))
- `description` (String) A descriptor of the feature
- `labels` (Map of String) A set of labels used to optionally filter execution of the feature
- `steps` (Attributes List) Actions to run against the harness. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--steps))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) ID is an encoded hash of the feature name and harness ID. It is used as a computed unique identifier of the feature within a given harness.

### Nested Schema for `harness`

Required:

- `id` (String)
- `inventory` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--harness--inventory))
- `name` (String)
- `skipped` (Boolean)

<a id="nestedatt--harness--inventory"></a>
### Nested Schema for `harness.inventory`

Required:

- `seed` (String)



<a id="nestedatt--after"></a>
### Nested Schema for `after`

Required:

- `cmd` (String) The command or set of commands that should be run at this step

Optional:

- `name` (String) An identifying name for this step
- `retry` (Attributes) Optional retry configuration for the step (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--after--retry))
- `workdir` (String) An optional working directory for the step to run in

<a id="nestedatt--after--retry"></a>
### Nested Schema for `after.retry`

Required:

- `attempts` (Number) The maximum number of attempts to retry the step.

Optional:

- `delay` (String) The delay to wait before retrying. Defaults to immediately retrying (0s).
- `factor` (Number) The factor to multiply the delay by on each retry. The default value of 1.0 means no delay increase per retry.



<a id="nestedatt--before"></a>
### Nested Schema for `before`

Required:

- `cmd` (String) The command or set of commands that should be run at this step

Optional:

- `name` (String) An identifying name for this step
- `retry` (Attributes) Optional retry configuration for the step (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--before--retry))
- `workdir` (String) An optional working directory for the step to run in

<a id="nestedatt--before--retry"></a>
### Nested Schema for `before.retry`

Required:

- `attempts` (Number) The maximum number of attempts to retry the step.

Optional:

- `delay` (String) The delay to wait before retrying. Defaults to immediately retrying (0s).
- `factor` (Number) The factor to multiply the delay by on each retry. The default value of 1.0 means no delay increase per retry.



<a id="nestedatt--steps"></a>
### Nested Schema for `steps`

Required:

- `cmd` (String) The command or set of commands that should be run at this step

Optional:

- `name` (String) An identifying name for this step
- `retry` (Attributes) Optional retry configuration for the step (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--steps--retry))
- `workdir` (String) An optional working directory for the step to run in

<a id="nestedatt--steps--retry"></a>
### Nested Schema for `steps.retry`

Required:

- `attempts` (Number) The maximum number of attempts to retry the step.

Optional:

- `delay` (String) The delay to wait before retrying. Defaults to immediately retrying (0s).
- `factor` (Number) The factor to multiply the delay by on each retry. The default value of 1.0 means no delay increase per retry.



<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

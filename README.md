# Terraform Provider Image Test

🚨 **This is a work in progress** 🚨

A terraform provider for authoring and executing tests using terraform primitives. Designed to work in conjunction with the [Chainguard Images](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/images) project. I would strongly recommend against using it for anything else.

See [examples](./examples) for usages, and [design](./DESIGN.md) for more information about the providers design.
